# assembly-ascii-converter
This project is written in x86 assembly language. The program take 10 valid(numbers that fit in 32-bit register) user inputs and manually converts the input strings to integers and stores them in an array. The program manually converts the integers to string values and displays them back to the user. Some arithmetic is done with the integers and is converted to strings and displayed as well. 

The setup to run this program is extensive. Please see the below screenshot of the program in action.
